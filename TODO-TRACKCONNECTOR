FIX: multi (ctrl-) and delete track
FIX: I should probably now fix the crash the happens when you completely undo a track and try to start again.

make it so I can see the track I'm making (color it different, maybe draw at end)
SHOW LENGTH! to easily compare lengths of different routes by undoing and redoing
merge TRW layers

get rid of the O(n^2) stuff and double edges:

settable allowance for "connected tracks" (including 0)

Thing to split up tracks or connect endpoints with non-endpoints... or crossing tracks...

start and end in middle of tracks (easy, just make new type of node with is_endpoint=MIDDLE and a trackpoint)


It would be nice to  somehow do it across multiple TRW layers... make the tool work on an AggregateLayer. And then show trail lengths coming from different layers! (road/trail/etc)
which gets all tracks of all trw layers and creates a new layer?
  (similar to calls needed to merge all trw layers -- getalltracksandwypointshashes -- add to list)
