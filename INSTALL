UNIX:

You must have GTK+ 2.2.0 or greater installed.

if from CVS:
aclocal \
&& autoheader \
&& automake -a && automake \
&& autoconf


./configure
make
strip --strip-all viking # optional)
cp viking /usr/local/bin # as root)
cp ../viking-remote /usr/local/bin # optional)

Or, if you are using GTK 2.2 (as opposed to 2.4 or greater):

cd src
make -f Makefile_GTK_2_2
strip --strip-all viking
cp viking /usr/local/bin
cp ../viking-remote /usr/local/bin

Try the "example.vik" file to get started.

Windows:
(Outdated info)
You must have Mingw and MSYS (?) installed. Set the path to include the GTK LIB
directory and the bin directory for mingw. Then just gcc -c each of source files
and link 'em together along with a bunch of GTK libs. I have batch files to do
all of this, I will include them in here soon. Cross-compiling with Linux
might also be possible but I've never tried it.
